# IrisClassifier

## Overview
This project implements a basic machine learning classification model using the
Iris dataset. Logistic Regression is used to classify iris flowers into
three species based on sepal and petal measurements.

## Features
- Uses the built-in Iris dataset from scikit-learn
- Train-test split for model evaluation
- Logistic Regression classifier
- Accuracy evaluation
- Data visualization using Matplotlib

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Output
The model prints classification accuracy and visualizes the dataset using
a scatter plot of sepal length vs sepal width.
